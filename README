This is a simple C source library for fuzzy string comparison. There isn't much
to say that isn't documented in the comments of the source files.

Read the header file for a brief overview of each function, and the .c file
for more specifics on the implementation, both in comments, and pure source
code.

The "startIDE.sh" file is not in the .gitignore file because I like to transfer
it to any machine I'm working on in the state I last updated it to.

The Makefile was left by mistake, while the test source file it refers to was
.gitignored. I will probably update this in the future to include these test
files in a demo directory.
